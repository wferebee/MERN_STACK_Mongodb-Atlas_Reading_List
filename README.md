# React_Router_Express_Books_CRUD

## link:  https://mern-books-ferebee.herokuapp.com/




## This full stack application is basically just a fancy reading list, it allows the user to add books to the list, delete books, and read the synopsis of chosen books.
This app was a struggle for me because mLab is no longer a resource on Heroku, so I had to do some research but I was ale to figure out Mongodb Atlas. I would definitely reccomend the service, it was very easy to use.

## Tech Used:
* React
* Express
* Mongodb Atlas
* Heroku
* Mongodb
* React Router
